## Overview
RoboReach has just finished its 4th year of reaching underprivileged students and giving them the tools and experience they need to keep up in a modern STEM classroom, and while we are very pleased with the progress and impact we have made on these studentsâ€™ lives, we continue to look forward into the future, thinking of how we can expand to create an even larger impact.

## Our History
Originally, our team started RoboReach with the goal of reaching out to as many students across the United States as possible. However, since the inception of our programs, they have seen a massive increase in registrations, going from only 50 the first year, to over 500 this past year! With this growth, we have been able to attract new sponsors and apply for more grants to further expand our program.

## Growth Plans
This next year, we aim to begin the global expansion of our programs! First, we will begin by opening registration to students in Canada and Mexico in the upcoming year to ensure we are well equipped for international students. They will each have their own separate class schedules and instructors, ensuring smoothness in the delivery of robots and instruction to the students.

Once our Canadian and Mexican programs get off the ground, we look to expand even further into Europe, Australia, and Asia! Our goal is to one day be able to deliver a robot and provide instruction to any student on Earth, no matter their background or country of residence. Currently, we are limited to areas with dense internet coverage due to our limited resources. However, we plan to be able to provide networking and internet to the students in the future, ensuring any student around the world, even in remote areas, is able to be afforded the same opportunity.
