## Who is Jaylen?
Jaylen is a 2nd grade student at Alston Ridge Elementary School in North Carolina. He's been described by his teachers as curious, intelligent, and always looking for a challenge. Jaylen always scores the highest possible points on every assignment, and feels that school isn't always a great challenge for him. 

## Interview with Jaylen
After Jaylen's common build program experience in the Academic year of 2021, Ganning interviewed him to get his feedback!

**Ganning**: How did you find out about RoboReach? What made you want to join the program?

**Jaylen**: I first discovered RoboReach from my teacher. Ms. Wilkins told me about a free and virtual robotics program that she thought I would be a perfect fit for. Also, there aren't many opportunities out there for 2nd grade students, so the RoboReach's program was both one of the only opportunities out there for me. After that, it was only a matter of my mom sending an email to RoboReach, and after a few questions, I was in!

**Ganning**: You mentioned that you loved the program, what was fun, interesting, or entertaining about it?

**Jaylen**: I loved meeting with my mentor everyday. At the beginning, he taught me how to assemble the lego robot together, showing me the best practices in creating the robot and making sure that I understood the WHY behind everything, not just what we are doing. After we built the basic robot, my mentor enouraged me to create add-ons, letting me be creative with what I wanted to build. The best part is that the parts needed for what I wanted to do, a robotic arm that can pick up items, was provided to me for free by RoboReach. By working together with my mentor, I truly believe that we developed a friendship, not just another teacher.

**Ganning**: How did balance RoboReach with school?

**Jaylen**: Maybe this is because I am only in second grade, but doing the RoboReach academic year program (Aug-Jun), both allowed me to create a robot that works and maintain all straight A's in school. RoboReach's mentors are also very flexible. If I'm being overwhelmed with work, I just needed to tell them, and they would either delay the meeting or push the meeting back to the next day.

**Ganning**: Would you recommend applying to RoboReach?

**Jaylen**: Yes, yes, and yes! RoboReacch's program is one of the best experiences I've had, from the supportive mentors to all the other smart students, I've met amazing people and built a lasting support system. In fact, one of my friends in the program, Jason, I've found out lives in the same city as I do, so I'm planning on going on a playdate with him next week! Also, the robot that I built taught me so much about building robots and using code to program them. Even if you don't think that you'll get in, your best shot is to apply, because if you don't apply, then you have no chance. However, if you just apply, you're giving yourself an opportunity at a life changing experience.
