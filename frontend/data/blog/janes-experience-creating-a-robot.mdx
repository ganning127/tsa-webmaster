My name is Jane Doe, and I am a 15 year old high school sophomore who recently attended the Creative Build RoboReach program. The program was a ton of fun, and I really learned a lot. The whole process was very beginner friendly, and I found it very easy to pick up on all of the concepts. One thing that was a huge help was my mentor. I was matched with Jane Dawson, who is a graduate student at North Carolina State University. My mentor really helped me to understand everything, and get as much as I could from the program. The instructions and materials that were given to me at the beginning of the 8 week session were very informative and helpful, but they could not compare to my mentor. Throughout the program my mentor was always there to catch my mistakes and help me work through difficulties I may be having. And due to the online format, it was super convenient to reach out to my mentor whenever I needed assistance.

Before RoboReach, I knew absolutely nothing about robotics. I barely knew what programming was, and if I were placed in a machine shop I would not be able to name a single part or tool. But now I feel like I have a basic understanding of some of the simplest, most fundamental programming and mechanical engineering concepts. My mentor went far more in depth about specific tools than the prewritten course materials I was provided. In having an active mentor, I was able to ask clarifying questions, and really get a solid understanding of the specific concepts and equipment that was relevant to the creation of my robot. They were like an endless supply of information. No matter what my problem was, they always had the answer. But more importantly than just correcting my mistakes and answering my questions, my mentor walked me through these issues so that I could see what went wrong and learn from it.

Not only was my mentor helpful, they were also extremely supportive. I was quite nervous in the beginning, due to my lack of experience, but my mentor made sure I felt comfortable with the program, and made sure I had fun along the way. They were never disapproving or negatively commented on my work; they were really encouraging, and helped me to improve and build on what I was able to do. With their help I have greatly increased my confidence, and I feel far less afraid to try new things now. While I find the field of robotics interesting, my mentor was the one who made a fun environment that had me excited to get to work each day. If it were not for them, my experience with RoboReach would have been drastically different.

Overall, the mentors involved with RoboReach really do a lot to improve the program and make sure everyone has a constructive, and enjoyable experience. I am so glad that I decided to apply to RoboReach, and I am excited to see what I can do next year.
