## Overview
This blog will walk through how to create a simple HTML/CSS website and deploy it on GitHub pages!

This website could be shared with anyone via the URL!

## Setup VSCode
For this tutorial, we will be using VSCode, which can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 

After downloading VSCode, click the `open` button to find a place to store your project!

Open/create a directory to store the files we will create! I will be storing my files in a folder called `hello-world-blog`. Click `open` to open the folder inside VSCode!

Click on the four boxes on the left pane to install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) VSCode extension. This allows us to test our webpage as we create it!

## Creating files
Now, let's go back to the first icon on the left pane (the one that looks like two sheets of paper)!

Click the "new file" icon at the top of the pane on the VSCode window, and name the file `index.html`.

> HTML files are the skeleton backbone of our website, it is where all the content goes!

Within your newly created HTML file, type `!` and click the `TAB` key on your keyboard. This generates an HTML template for us!

If that did not work for whatever reason, the code is also below:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```

Within the `<body>` tags in the HTML file, type `<h1>Hello World!</h1>`. Press `CMD + S` or `CTRL + S` to save your file!

## Loading our website!
Once you have created your HTML file, let's load our website to see what we've created!

Type `CMD + SHIFT + P` or `CTRL + SHIFT + P` to open the command palette on VSCode and type in `live server`. Select the open that says `open with live server` and click enter!

That should automatically open up a URL in your browser and you'll be able to see the website you have so far! However, if that does not work, head to `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html` to see your website!

## Adding CSS
Now, that website doesn't look very pretty, so lets create a new file called `style.css`.
![](https://i.imgur.com/SY5GFMk.png)
> CSS is what makes websites look pretty!

Now, type the following code into the `style.css` file:
```css
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
    color: darkblue;
}
```

Save the CSS file, and let's head back to our `index.html file`. We need to link the css file we just created with our HTML file, so let's add a link tag in the `<head>` element!

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`

The entire HTML file should look like:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>

</html>
```

Now, let's go to our website and see the changes! Make sure to save your CSS and HTML files!

Now, this website looks pretty awesome.

## Deploying our website (for FREE)!

Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/), which is where we will deploy our website!

Once you've created a Github account, create a [new repository](https://github.com/new)

Name your repository anything you'd like! I'm going to name mine `hello-world-blog`

Click the `Create Repository` button to create your repo!

Let's upload our files to GitHub! Click the `uploading an existing file` link!
![](https://i.imgur.com/cRzR6ZV.png)

Select the `upload` option and find the folder where you saved your HTML and CSS files from before. You can select multiple files in this dialog box by holding down `CMD` or `CTRL` as you click on each file. Click `open` to upload your files.

Once you upload your files, click `commit changes` at the bottom of the two boxes! Your files are now on GitHub!

**Now, we need to deploy our repo**

Click on the `settings` button to access the settings of your repo!

From there, click on the `pages` tab on the left side.

*Note: The website will take a few minutes to publish, so you might need to wait for a few minutes to access it!*
